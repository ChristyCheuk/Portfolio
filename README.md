This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Christy. I am an MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses on two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective. 

The picture below is where I studied in Australia. After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I am here at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completing my master’s degree in the United States.

Recently, I am interested in astrology. It is a way for me to learn more about myself and others by figuring out how to better communicate with each other. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a data analyst that is able to provide valuable insights for clients achieving their goals, and therefore I am looking forward to learning about designing data visualizations as well as explaining and presenting data supported by related narratives using software such as Tableau. Also, I am interested in learning about building an online portfolio using a platform such as Github, combining the techniques and methods I will learn from this class to make my portfolio stand out from other candidates. Besides, I hope to build up a certain level of critique standards for myself to continue to improve my data visualizations in the future.

## Data visualization critique 
[Data visualization critique](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4KejSpVYsY0bVbTuGnZ5IqE1TTPp8nr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113615484674101933870&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Visualizing government debt
[Visualizing government debt](/dataviz2.md)

### Government Debt Bar Chart
It represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as Estonia had the lowest ratios and Japan had the highest.

### 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Line Chart
It represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years using the grid of line charts, so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time. For example, Spain had the shortest period of government debt-to-GDP ratio. Besides, it has grey lines and makes a dot at the end of the trend line, so it helps the audience connect the x-axis to the y-axis to some extent and spot where the trend line ends. 

### 2021 Top 10 Highest Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Pie Chart
In addition to putting on a clear headline and x-axis and y-axis labels, I put a two-line description in the smaller type under the headline to briefly add on what government debt-to-GDP ratio is and why it is important in order to help the audience have a better understanding of the chart. I also highlighted the top 10 countries that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in red and made the rest grey so that the audience can focus on the highest ones. If they would like to filter out or choose one or a number of specific countries, I also turned on the legend mode so they can simply click on the boxes above the chart. I chose the pie chart because I wanted to know the percentage of the top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage of the countries around the world. With the pie chart, I found that the top 10 countries that had the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio occupied over 50% of the total debt-to-GDP ratio. In other words, the top 10 countries had more government debt-to-GDP ratio than the sum of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of the rest of the countries. 

### Comparison
A bar chart is one of the most effective tools to visualize data in a readable and understandable format. A bar chart is better used for representing a vast amount of data and comparing different values. The Government Debt Bar Chart represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as Estonia had the lowest ratios and Japan had the highest.

Compared to a bar chart which is better used for larger changes, a line chart is better used for representing changing trends and developments over time. The 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Line Chart represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years, so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time. For example, Spain had the shortest period of government debt-to-GDP ratio.

Compared to a bar chart which is better used for category comparison or a line chart which is better used for representing trends over time, a pie chart is better used for showing the relationship between a whole and its parts. I chose the pie chart because I wanted to know the percentage of the top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage of the countries around the world. The pie chart shows that the top 10 countries that had the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio occupied over 50% of the total debt-to-GDP ratio. In other words, the top 10 countries had more government debt-to-GDP ratio than the sum of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of the rest of the countries.

#### Insights
insights you gained from the critique method, 
what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.
how you moved next to the sketches, 
any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  





### Final Design
Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  
1. Changed colors: the users thought the colors I used were unrelated to the theme and therefore I changed the color of the number of avocado toasts column to avocado green and the color of the average apartment deposit column to blue as an analogous color.  
2. Added year: the users were confused about when the data was: was it recent? or was it a few years ago? I added the year of the data to the title.
3. Added description: although having a basic sense of what the message of the visualization was conveying: how many avocado toasts to buy a house, the users were not completely sure about where the data came from or how the data came out and that made them doubt about the creditibly of the visualization. I added a few lines of descriptions under the headline to briefly describing where the data was from to make it more trustworthy. 
4. Moved the locations of labels: the users thought putting the labels inside the bar chart were a bit crowdy and they had to spend a few seconds looking for where the labels were. I moved the labels to the top of the chart.

what your redesigned data visualization shows, 
In addition to the user feedback, I also made two more adjustments. 
1. I added some background information briefly describing why putting avocado toasts and an apartment together. Comparing avocado toasts that is close to our daily life to the deposit that is relatively far away from our daily life can provide us a more concrete idea of how the deposit looks like, such as is it too high or too low? 
2. I added legend so if the users want to focus on either one set of data, they can easily filter out the other one. 


why you selected the data visualization you did,
what you attempted to show or do differently.
I selected bar chart because I want to see the comparsion of the average apartment deposit and the number of avocado toasts in 10 cities around the world. It is one of the most effective tools to compare data in a readable and understandable format. 

I would like show a few things
1. the comparsion between avocado toasts and an apartment: puting two color bars together, the users should be able to find that the long blue bar acutally is just equal to the short green bar, aligning that Comparing avocado toasts that is close to our daily life to the deposit that is relatively far away from our daily life can provide us a more concrete idea of how the deposit looks like, such as is it too high or too low? take Hong Kong as an example. Moving your cursor to the bar, you will be able to see the pop up window showing the average avocado toast price is $14/piece. If we save money on 26,858 pieces of avocado toasts, we will get $376,011 and will be able to get to buy an apartment. 
2. show from the highest to the lowest average aparment deposit in 10 cities around the world: with the legend, the user filter out the number of avocado toasts to focus on the average apartment. The visualization will be able to provide them a quick sense of which city has the highest home price while which city has the lowest home price. 
3. show from the highest to the lowest number of avocado toasts in 10 cities around the world: simiarly, with the legend, the user filter out the average apartment price to focus on the number of avocado toasts. instead of using money as units, Comparing avocado toasts that is close to our daily life to the deposit that is relatively far away from our daily life can provide us a more concrete idea of how the deposit looks like. For example, in Hong Kong averae apartment deposit of $376,011 equals to 26,858 pieces of avocado toasts sounds like a lot of toasts and that must be high.
