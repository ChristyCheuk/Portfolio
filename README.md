This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Christy. I'm an MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses on two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective. 

The picture below is where I studied in Australia. After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I am here at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completing my master’s degree in the United States.

Recently, I’m interested in astrology. It is a way for me to learn more about myself and others by figuring out how to better communicate with each other. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a data analyst that is able to provide valuable insights for clients achieving their goals, and therefore I am looking forward to learning about designing data visualizations as well as explaining and presenting data supported by related narratives using software such as Tableau. Also, I am interested in learning about building an online portfolio using a platform such as Github, combining the techniques and methods I will learn from this class to make my portfolio stand out from other candidates. Besides, I hope to build up a certain level of critique standards for myself to continue to improve my data visualizations in the future.

## Visualizing government debt
### Government Debt Bar Chart

### 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Column Charts
In addition to putting on a clear headline and x-axis and y-axis labels, I put a two-line description in smaller type under the headline to briefly add on what government debt-to-GDP ratio is and why it is important in order to help the audience have a better understanding of the chart. I also highlighted the top 10 countries that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio and made the rest grey so that the audience can focus on, and if they would like to filter out or choose a specific country, I also turned on legend mode so they can simply click on the boxes above the column charts.

### Comparsion
<!-- Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and 
how they compare / contrast to one another. 
Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  
Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  -->

Line charts are ideal for showing changing time series as well as trends and developments over time. 
Bar charts are good for comparing size, especially on small screens.
Similar to bar charts, I chose column charts becuase they were an effective tool to compare the difference between values.
