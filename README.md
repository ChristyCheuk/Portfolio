# About me
My name is Christy. I'm a MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses in two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective.

After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I will go to the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to complete my masterâ€™s degree in the United States.
