This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Christy. I'm an MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses on two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective. 

The picture below is where I studied in Australia. After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I am here at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completing my master’s degree in the United States.

Recently, I’m interested in astrology. It is a way for me to learn more about myself and others by figuring out how to better communicate with each other. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a data analyst that is able to provide valuable insights for clients achieving their goals, and therefore I am looking forward to learning about designing data visualizations as well as explaining and presenting data supported by related narratives using software such as Tableau. Also, I am interested in learning about building an online portfolio using a platform such as Github, combining the techniques and methods I will learn from this class to make my portfolio stand out from other candidates. Besides, I hope to build up a certain level of critique standards for myself to continue to improve my data visualizations in the future.
