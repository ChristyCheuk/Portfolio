This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Christy. I am an MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses on two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective. 

The picture below is where I studied in Australia. After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I am here at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completing my masterâ€™s degree in the United States.

Recently, I am interested in astrology. It is a way for me to learn more about myself and others by figuring out how to better communicate with each other. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a data analyst that is able to provide valuable insights for clients achieving their goals, and therefore I am looking forward to learning about designing data visualizations as well as explaining and presenting data supported by related narratives using software such as Tableau. Also, I am interested in learning about building an online portfolio using a platform such as Github, combining the techniques and methods I will learn from this class to make my portfolio stand out from other candidates. Besides, I hope to build up a certain level of critique standards for myself to continue to improve my data visualizations in the future.

## Data visualization critique

## Visualizing government debt
### Government Debt Bar Chart
The Government Debt Bar Chart represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as which countries have the lowest and the highest ratios.

### 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Grid of Line Charts
The 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Grid of Line Charts represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years using the discrete distribution, so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time.

### 2021 The Top 10 Highest Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Pie Chart
In addition to putting on a clear headline and x-axis and y-axis labels, I put a two-line description in the smaller type under the headline to briefly add on what government debt-to-GDP ratio is and why it is important in order to help the audience have a better understanding of the chart. I also highlighted the top 10 countries that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in red and made the rest grey so that the audience can focus on the highest ones. If they would like to filter out or choose a or a number of specific countries, I also turned on the legend mode so they can simply click on the boxes above the chart.

### Comparison
Bar charts are one of the most effective tools to visualize data in a readable and understandable format. Bar charts are better used for representing a vast amount of data and comparing different values. The Government Debt Bar Chart represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as which countries have the lowest and the highest ratios.

Compared to bar charts which are better used for larger changes, line charts are better used for representing changing trends and developments over time. The 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Grid of Line Charts represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years using the discrete distribution so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time.

Compared to bar charts which are better used for category comparison or line charts which are better used for representing trends over time, a pie chart is better used for showing how a whole is comprised of different parts. I chose the pie chart because I wanted to know the percentage of the top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage of the countries around the world. With the pie chart, I found that the top 10 countries that had the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio occupied over 50% of the total debt-to-GDP ratio in the world. In other words, the top 10 countries had more government debt-to-GDP ratio than the sum of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of the rest of the countries.
