This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Christy. I'm an MISM Global student. I decided to take the global pathway to study in Australia and the United States because it is an exciting intercontinental option. By studying at two campuses on two hemispheres, I can access a global network of professors, experts, classmates, and alumni. I will have an intercontinental learning experience that will help me develop a holistic perspective. 

The picture below is where I studied in Australia. After finishing my first year studying at the Australian campus, I am here at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completing my master’s degree in the United States.

Recently, I’m interested in astrology. It is a way for me to learn more about myself and others by figuring out how to better communicate with each other. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a data analyst that is able to provide valuable insights for clients achieving their goals, and therefore I am looking forward to learning about designing data visualizations as well as explaining and presenting data supported by related narratives using software such as Tableau. Also, I am interested in learning about building an online portfolio using a platform such as Github, combining the techniques and methods I will learn from this class to make my portfolio stand out from other candidates. Besides, I hope to build up a certain level of critique standards for myself to continue to improve my data visualizations in the future.

## Visualizing government debt

### 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Column Charts
In addition to putting on a clear headline and x-axis and y-axis labels, I put a two-line description in the smaller type under the headline to briefly add on what government debt-to-GDP ratio is and why it is important in order to help the audience have a better understanding of the chart. I also highlighted the top 10 countries that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio and made the rest grey so that the audience can focus on the highest ones, and if they would like to filter out or choose a specific country, I also turned on legend mode so they can simply click on the boxes above the column charts.

### Comparison
Bar charts and column charts are two of the most effective tools to visualize data in a readable and understandable format. Compared to bar charts which are better used for representing a vast amount of data with lengthy labels such as how it looks in the Government Debt Bar Chart, column charts are better used for comparing different values. I chose column charts also because it was one of the most accessible charts to compare the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the highest to the lowest so that it could provide the audience a quick sense of the ratio among countries, such as which countries have the highest and the lowest ratios. 

Line charts are better used for representing changing times series or trends and developments. Compared to bar and column charts which are better used for comparing larger changes, line charts are better used for smaller changes over time.
