# Final Project
## Progress
#### Decide a topic - Done
- Find a topic that I am interested in or closely related to my daily life that I would like to say 
- Decide who the audience will be 

#### Research on the topic - Done
- Make sure its data is accessible 

#### Sketches - Done
- Brainstorm what I would like to put in the final design 

#### Collect feedback – by November 27
- Method: interview people from different backgrounds  
- Estimated time: 15 minutes
-	Format: in-person/remote/survey
-	Prompts: What do you think this is? What is this telling you? Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? Is there anything you would change or do differently? 

#### Revise based on feedback – by November 29
-	Organize the feedback by trying to find patterns
-	Reflect on what I learned from the feedback 
-	Come up with changes I would make the most sense in the final design 

#### Deliver the final design – by December 8 
-	Use flourish/Tableau to refine the design
-	Use shorthand to build the story 


## Outline
Nowadays, a phone plays an important role in my daily life and can do a lot of things, such as keeping in touch with our families and friends, browsing social media to check for updates on the world, doing shopping, and so on. 

In my final report, I would like to discuss that I usually feel satisfied when doing those activities, but to some extent, also feel those are not the things I truly want to do. Why will I have these contradictory feelings? 

“Happiness” and “Pleasure” may have subtle language differences but huge chemical differences. Our brain has two different parts: serotonin deal with happiness, and dopamine deals with pleasure. The former is associated with long-term contentment from activities such as giving and sharing. It makes the brain feel good and that is enough. On the other hand, the latter is associated with short-term rewards and motivation from activities such as taking. It makes the brain feel good and wants more and therefore easy to leads to addiction. 

As the below story arc shows, using a phone makes me feel pleasure at the beginning, but as time passes on, I feel bad until I turn off the phone and start doing something meaningful to make myself feel truly happy.

Overall, as a reader, I want to find long-term contentment so that I can get real happiness. I can do this by spending less time on the phone and more time on meaningful things. I am interested in showing:
- Comparing how people think phones make their life
- Because of serotonin and dopamine, spending time on something meaningful can bring more happiness than phones can
- Call for the action of spending time on something meaningful instead of on a phone


## Initial sketches
### Bar chart
I sketched a bar chart to compare the percentage of people feeling happy, pleasure, and miserable in the short- and long-term when using a phone. I put short- and long-term next to each other and grouped them by feelings. We can clearly see the percentage changes over the short- and long-term and an increase or decrease. Therefore, I put the headline "How do people feel in the short- and long-term when using a phone?" I also plan to put the year of data on and add the percentages on the bars to make them look more clear.

### Line chart
I sketched a line chart to see the trend of feeling based on the time spent on something meaningful and the phone respectively. We can see that the former reaches happiness for a longer duration while the latter only reaches pleasure for a shorter duration. Therefore, I put the headline "Spending time on something meaningful can bring more happiness than a phone can" to call for action on spending more time on something meaningful instead of on a phone. I also plan to add text boxes showing what the brain says at the peaks of both lines to provide more information in order to help the audience better understand the difference between happiness and pleasure.

## Data
I would mainly use the data from research websites including the National Library of Medicine and ResearchGate and also news websites including Business Insider and the Guardian. 

I would focus on students and would need the data related to their phone use and happiness. The URLs below provide data on students' mobile phone addiction index (MPAI) and satisfaction with life scale (SWLS). I believe that will provide the information I need to visualize the relationships between phone use and happiness.

I also need the data related to the research about the relationships between using phones and dopamine dealing with pleasure as well as doing something meaningful and serotonin dealing with happiness. The URLs below provide data on how phone use affects dopamine and how doing meaningful things affects serotonin. I believe that will provide the information I need to visualize the relationships between different events and dopamine and serotonin activities.

## Method and medium
I would use Shorthand for my final deliverable. It has many templates that are suitable for the theme of my final report. I would also use data visualization tools such as Flourish and Tableau to visualize the data and add related narratives and then add them to Shorthand in hopes to provide the audience with a better visualization.
