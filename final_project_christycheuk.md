# Outline
Nowadays, a phone plays an important role in our daily life and can do a lot of things, such as keeping in touch with our families and friends, browsing social media to check for updates on the world, shopping, and so on. We usually feel satisfied when doing those activities but to some extent, also feeling not those are the things we truly want. Why will we have this contradictory feeling? “Happiness” and “Pleasure” may have subtle language differences but huge chemical differences. Our brain has two different parts: serotonin deal with happiness, and dopamine deals with pleasure. The former is associated with long-term contentment from activities such as giving and sharing. It makes the brain feel good and enough and therefore is not addictive. On the other hand, the latter is associated with short-term rewards and motivation from activities such as taking. It makes the brain feel good and wants more and therefore easy to leads to addiction.
