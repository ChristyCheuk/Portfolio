# Final Project Part III: Final project and presentation
## Summary
### Changes made since the completion of Part II
One change I had worked on since the completion of part II was to try to find some more updated data. Based on the feedback I received from part II, the participants noticed that the data I was using was from a few years ago and thought that could be more helpful for presenting the topic if I could find some more recent data. It was unfornately that I had not been able to find some new data via public access source, so I kept the current data. 

I made a few additional changes in addition to the feedback. In the My Weekly Phone Activities chart, my phone activities were into six categories according to my phone screen time report. It might not clear enough for the audience to find out what under each category, so I added some narratives. I found an interesting conclusion from the World Happiness Report stating the relationships between happiness and electric devices, so I added it to my story. 

After finialing all the elements I would put into my story, I used Shorthand for my story.  

### Target Audience
The audience will be students who spend a lot of time on their phones. I would like to call for the action for spending time on non-phone activities instead of phone activities.

### Information used that helped narrow the focus
At the very beginning, there was a large portion of my story talking about three sub-topics: dopamin and serotonin, pleasure and happiness, and phone and non-phone activities. After receiving the in-class feedback, it seemed to them there were too many contents. Even though it was logical to explain how the relationships between these three sub-topics, it was not neccessay to go too deep into how dopamin and serotonin worked biologically. Breifly explaining how dopamin and serotonin were associated with the later two topics and then focus on the relationships between the later two topics would be more helpful for clearly bringing out the main topic. 

That was the first big change I made to narrow the content. After finializing what I was going to include, I started worked on the data visualizations. I talked with the people around me that spent a lot of time on phone activities such as using social media or watching TV shows based my acquaintance with them. The participants provided a few recommendations on the design and the content, including changing colors, adding descriptions, and updating the data.

Although having a basic sense of what the message of the visualization was conveying, the participants were not completely sure about it. I added a few lines of descriptions to try to make the visualizations look more readable and understandable. The participants found that stacked bars made them feel confused and took them some time to figure out how the numbers came out. I, therefore, changed it to grouped bar chart to make it look easier to understand. I would like to emphasize the lowest point at the year of iPhone was released. The participants thought using contrast colors would be helpful for showing the comparison between non-phone and phone activities, so I changed the colors to blue and red. Also, the participants thought there were too many activities on the y-axis, and would be helpful if highlighted the most impactful ones. Therefore, I used darker blue and red for the top three activities of each category and lighter blue and red for the rest.

### Design decisions and lesson learned
One of the most important decisions I had to make along the way was to leverage the visualizations and the messages. For example, if there was a visualization I prefer but it was not the best fit of the message, should I try to make adjustment on it to make it fit into the message or should I choose a more suitable visualization? In this case, I would make the final decision based on how it look like from the audience's perspective, such as which one would make the message to be more readable and undertandable? If I was the audience, would I like this visualization or the other?

Working through the process, I learned how to think from different persona. I had to keep switching roles between an author and an audience by imagining myself having no knowledge about the topic. Therefore, I would have to add related information including a clear headline, labels, descriptions and narratives to the visualizations readable and understandable. However, I had to keep all the elements within an appropriate range, so the visualizations would not look too busy for the audience.
