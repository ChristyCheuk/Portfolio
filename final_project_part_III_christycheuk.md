## Summary
### Changes made since the completion of Part II
One change I had worked on since the completion of part II was to try to find some more updated data. Based on the feedback I received from part II, the participants noticed that the data I was using was from a few years ago and thought that could be more helpful for presenting the topic if I could find some more recent data. It was unfortunate that I had not been able to find some new data via public access source, so I kept the current data. 

I made a few additional changes in addition to the feedback. In the My Weekly Phone Activities chart, my phone activities were grouped into six categories according to my phone screen time report. It might not be clear enough for the audience to find out what was under each category, so I added some narratives. Also, I found an interesting conclusion from the World Happiness Report stating the relationships between happiness and electric devices, so I added it to my story. 

After finalizing all the elements I would put into my story, I used Shorthand for my story.  

### Target Audience
The audience will be students who spend a lot of time on their phones. I would like to call for action for spending time on non-phone activities instead of phone activities.

### Information used and adjustments made
At the very beginning, there was a large portion of my story talked about three sub-topics: dopamine and serotonin, pleasure and happiness, and phone and non-phone activities. After receiving the in-class feedback, it seemed to them that there was too much content. They suggested even though it was logical to explain how the relationships between these three sub-topics, it was not necessary to go too deep into how dopamine and serotonin worked biologically. Briefly explaining how dopamine and serotonin were associated with the latter two topics and then focusing on the relationships between the latter two topics would be more helpful for clearly bringing out the main topic. That was the first big change I made to narrow the content. 

After finalizing what I was going to include, I started working on the data visualizations. I talked with the people (students) around me that spent a lot of time on phone activities such as using social media or watching TV shows based on my acquaintance with them. The participants provided a few recommendations on the design and the content, including changing colors and adding descriptions. For example, the participants thought using contrast colors would be helpful for showing the comparison between phone and non-phone activities, so I changed the colors to red and blue. Also, the participants thought there were too many activities on the y-axis, and would be helpful if highlighted the most impactful ones. Therefore, I used darker red and blue for the top three activities of each category and lighter colors for the rest. Those helped to better convey the message. 

### Design decisions and lessons learned
One of the most important decisions I had to make along the way was to leverage the visualizations and the messages. For example, if there was a visualization I prefer but it was not the best fit for the message, should I try to make an adjustment to it to make it fit into the message or should I choose a more suitable visualization? In this case, I would make the final decision based on how it looks like from the audience's perspective, such as which one would make the message to be more readable and understandable? If I was the audience, would I like this visualization or the other?

Working through the process, I learned how to think from a different persona. I had to keep switching roles between an author and an audience by imagining myself having no knowledge about the topic. Therefore, I would have to add related information including a clear headline, labels, descriptions, and narratives to the visualizations readable and understandable. However, I had to keep all the elements within an appropriate range, so the visualizations would not look too busy to the audience.
