## Wireframe and storyboard
As a reader, I want to find long-term contentment so that I can get real happiness. I can do this by spending less time on the phone and more time on non phone activities. I will be showing:
- the difference between pleasure and happiness associated with dopamine and serotonin respectively
- how the phone make our life
- spending time on non phone activities can bring more happiness than the phone can
- call for the action of spending time on non phone activities instead of on the phone

Narrative: “Happiness” and “Pleasure” may have subtle language differences but huge chemical differences.

Narrative: Our brain has two different parts: serotonin deal with happiness, and dopamine deals with pleasure. The former is associated with long-term contentment from activities such as giving and sharing. It makes the brain feel good and that is enough. On the other hand, the latter is associated with short-term rewards and motivation from activities such as taking. It makes the brain feel good and wants more and therefore easy to leads to addiction.

Narrative: I tried to use a stacked bar chart to show my last week phone activities based on my phone screen time and found that I spent 6 hours, one forth of a day on entertainment on average. 

### Page 4
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12015562"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
Narrative: I am not the only one spending most of the time of a day on phone. 73% of America's 18- to 29-year-olds have to check on their phones at least several times an hour and of those, 22% have to check on their phones every few minutes. 

### Page 5 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12022456"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
Narrative: I highlighed 2007 which is the year of iPhone released. At the same year, we can see that the happiness scale slides down to the bottom. Up until 2015, the happiness scale has not be back to the level ten years ago.

### Page 6
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12021246"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
Narrative: Following up on the previous chart, the more time we spend on phones, the less happiness we will have. This line chart shows the standarized scores of phone usage hours and general happiness.

### Page 7 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12027686"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
Narrative: I would like to call for the action of spending time on non phone activities instead of phone activities.  Because of serotonin and dopamine, spending time on non phone activities can bring more happiness than phone activities can. This bar chart shows the comparsion of non phone and phone activities. There is a positive correlation between non phone activities and happiness and a negative correlation between phone activities and happiness. I used contrast colors such that blue and red to distinct non phone and phone activities and also used darker colors to highlight the most impactful ones.


## User research 
### Protocol
- Target audience: the audience will be students who usually feel satisfied when doing phone activities, but also feel those are not the things they truly want to do, and curious about why they will have these contradictory feelings.
- Method: I will talk with people around me from different backgrounds and then make an in-person or remote interview or have them filled out a survey. 
- Estimated time: 15 minutes
-	Format: in-person/remote/survey
-	Prompts: What do you think this is? What is this telling you? Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? Is there anything you would change or do differently? 

### Participants
#### Participant 1: Female, student, early 20's
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

The audience should be teenagers.

- What do you think this is?

I think this is pretty cleary that these are different types/versions of charts. 

- What is this telling you?

I think this is trying to tell me that pleasure is different with happiness. What we get from using phones is simiply pleasure but not happiness. Therefore, we should focus less on phone activities but more on non phone activities. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

I like the way you visualize pleasure and happiness and associated dopamine and serotonin in the brian. I am a bit confused about the fourth chart though. It took me some time to figure out it should be a percentage and how the number came out. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

I feel like it would be great if you could add some descriptions about what "correlation" in those graphs. Also, I would probably change the color of the last chart if you wanted to show the contrast between non phone activities and phone activities. One more thing, it would be great if you could provide some more updated data.

#### Participant 2: Male, student, mid 20's
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

The audience should be teenagers. However, I couldn't hundred percent sure about who your intended audience would be before I saw the fourth graph. It could be helpful if you could point it out directly at the beginning.

- What do you think this is?

Different charts.

- What is this telling you?

The negative correlation between using the phone and happiness. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

For the chart on page 3, at first glance, I would think that the light blue and dark blue are independent, rather than the latter containing the former relationship.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

It would be helpful if you could explain what positive and negative correlation mean. 
In addition, for the chart on page 3, as there are a lot of data, the most obvious ones can be highlighted. For example, sleep, sports and social are useful for happiness, while listening to music and the internet will adversely affect happiness.

#### Participant 3: Male, student, early 20's
- Who do you think the intended audience is? 

The main audience for this data analysis is teenagers and young adults because the second picture mentions 18-29 years old, and the third picture mentions grades 8 to 10.

- What do you think this is?

Different types of charts including column chart, bar chart and line chart. 

- What is this telling you?

The number and duration of using mobile phones may affect people's happiness index.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The first graph surprised me. From the graph, I understand that as time goes by, the overall "Happiness" index decreases, and there is a clear contrast with the number of times you use your phone. However, happiness may be related to the economic environment and social environment. For example, the financial crisis in 2008 caused "Happiness" to plummet. After the economy entered quantitative easing, the economy gradually recovered, so "Happiness" skyrocketed.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

In the second and third graphs, the description and units of the x-axis and y-axis can be added.

## Findings
### Patterns

Participants could clearly tell that the type of visualization and its message, had the same guess on the intended audience, and shared the same concern about the bar chart on page 3. They also provided different recommendations on the design and the content, including changing colors, adding descritpions and updating the data. 

### Learned from feedback

I learned my visualization was able to convey the message as it was supposed to. However, there were some places that I would need to make more clarification to make it more understandable from the audience’s perspective. 

### Changes
#### Changes made

- Added descriptions
- Changed the bar chart on page 3 from stacked to grouped
- Added a highlight at the year of iPhone released in 2007 to the line chart on page 5
- Changed colors of the bar chart on page 7: the participants thought using contrast colors would be helpful for showing the comparsion between non phone and phone activities, so I changed the colors to blue and red. Also, the participants thought there are too many activities on y-axis and would be helpful if highlighting out the most impactful ones, so I used darker blue and red for the top three activities ones of each catergory and lighter blue and red for the rest. 

#### Changes will be made in the near future
- Try to find some more updated data: the participants noticed that most of data I am using was a few years ago and thought that would be more convincible if I could find some more recent data. It will take time to find this kind of data and I will try to update the data in the near future.
