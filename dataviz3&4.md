### Test and feedback
- Participant 1: Female, adult, late 50's

Participant 1 could clearly tell that it was a bar chart and a pretty straightforward visualization saying how many avocado toasts cost to buy an apartment. She also mentioned that avocado toasts here should be playing pretty much the same role as money. In this case, Hong Kong is the most one. She was pretty surprised that putting avocado toast and the housing market together. One thing that looks interesting to her was that it was hard for her to imagine that in Hong Kong, the apartment deposit that cost almost $400k only needed less than 50k pieces of avocado toast. She was a bit doubtful about the data source though. She guessed the intended audience should be whoever was interested in studying the global housing market or loved avocado toasts. She would probably change the colors as they did not remind her of a lot of avocado toasts.  

- Participant 2: Male, student, late 10's

Participant 1 could clearly tell that it was a bar chart and Hong Kong had the highest average apartment deposit and therefore needs the most avocado toasts. However, he mentioned that he could not see when the data was published. He was also a bit confused about why I would want to put these two objects together as they look irrelated to him. He guessed the intended audience should be someone who wanted to learn more about the world's home prices in a different way. He would add lines or numbers next to each bar because he mentioned that he was keeping putting his finger up and down to try to connect the bars and the values at the bottom. 

- Patterns
Both participants could clearly tell that the type of visualization and its message, had the same guess on the intended audience, and shared the same concern about the creditability of the data. They provided different recommendations on the design and the content, including the colors, and adding numbers next to each bar. 

- Learn from the feedback
I learned my visualization was able to convey the message as it was supposed to. However, there were some places that I would need to make more clarification to make it more understandable from the audience’s perspective. 

- Changes
I came up with making changes to colors, adding numbers, and descriptions.

I chose this visualization because I was impressed by the creativity of using avocado toasts instead of money to show how expensive or inexpensive an apartment can be. It is an interesting visualization to look at. I like its colors and how it tries to make everything concrete by putting avocado toast, a dollar bill, and the iconic buildings of the cities. In addition, the housing market is usually a dull topic for me. Using avocado toasts instead of traditional charts can not only bring in a new perspective of how the home prices are like nowadays but also makes it more related to my daily life and therefore attract me to learn more about it. Another reason I chose this visualization is that I wanted to make it more comparable. The visualization was divided into five parts. I had to scroll up and down to go through the entire visualization and to make comparisons between different countries.

#### Insights
Based on the feedback, I made some changes:
- Changed colors: the participants thought the colors I used were unrelated to the theme and therefore I changed the color of the number of avocado toasts column to avocado green and the color of the average apartment deposit column to an analogous blue.  
- Added numbers: the participants mentioned it was hard to connect the x-axis to its bar because of the distance, particularly from the top bars, so I added numbers beside the bars. 
- Added description: although having a basic sense of what the message of the visualization was conveying: how many avocado toasts to buy a house, the users were not completely sure about where the data came from or how the data came out, and that made them doubt about the creditably of the visualization. I added a few lines of descriptions to briefly describe where the data was from to make it more trustworthy. I also added some background information briefly describing why putting avocado toast and an apartment together. Comparing avocado toast that is close to our daily life to the deposit that is relatively far away from our daily life can provide the audience with a more concrete idea of how the deposit looks like, such as whether is it too high or too low. 
- Added year: the participants were confused about when the data was: was it recent? or was it a few years ago? I added the year of the data to the title.

I selected a bar chart because I want to see the comparison of the average apartment deposit and the number of avocado toasts in 10 cities around the world. It is one of the most effective tools to compare data in a readable and understandable format. In addition to the user feedback, I also made an additional adjustment:
-	I added a legend so if the users want to focus on either one set of data, they can easily filter out the other one. 

With the bar chart, I would like to show a few things: 
- Comparison between avocado toasts and an apartment: putting two color bars together, the audience should be able to compare avocado toasts that are close to our daily life to the deposit that is relatively far away from our daily life and therefore can provide them a more concrete idea of how the deposit looks like, such as is it high or low? Take Hong Kong as an example. Moving the cursor to the bar, they will be able to see a pop-up window showing the average avocado toast price is $14/piece. If we save money on 26,858 pieces of avocado toast, we will get $376,011 and will be able to get to pay for a 20% apartment deposit. In other words, 26,858 pieces of avocado toast equal an apartment deposit.
- Show from the highest to the lowest average apartment deposit in 10 cities around the world: with the legend, the audience is able to filter out the number of avocado toasts to focus on the average apartment. The visualization will be able to provide them with a quick sense of which city has the highest home price and which city has the lowest home price. 
- Show from the highest to the lowest number of avocado toasts in 10 cities around the world: similarly, with the legend, the audience is able to filter out the average apartment price to focus on the number of avocado toasts. Instead of using money as units, comparing avocado toast to the deposit can provide us with a more concrete idea of what the deposit looks like. For example, in Hong Kong, an average apartment deposit of $376,011 equals 26,858 pieces of avocado toast sound like a lot of toast and that must be high.
