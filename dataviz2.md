# Visualizing government debt
## Government Debt Bar Chart
The bar chart represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as Estonia had the lowest ratios and Japan had the highest.

## 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Line Chart
The line chart represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years using the grid of line charts, so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time. For example, Spain had the shortest period of government debt-to-GDP ratio. Besides, it has grey lines and makes a dot at the end of the trend line, so it helps the audience connect the x-axis to the y-axis to some extent and spot where the trend line ends.

## 2021 Top 10 Highest Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Pie Chart
In addition to putting on a clear headline and x-axis and y-axis labels, I put a two-line description in the smaller type under the headline to briefly add on what government debt-to-GDP ratio is and why it is important in order to help the audience have a better understanding of the chart. I also highlighted the top 10 countries that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in red and made the rest grey so that the audience can focus on the highest ones. If they would like to filter out or choose one or a number of specific countries, I also turned on the legend mode so they can simply click on the boxes above the chart. I chose the pie chart because I wanted to know the percentage of the top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage of the countries around the world. With the pie chart, I found that the top 10 countries that had the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio occupied over 50% of the total debt-to-GDP ratio. In other words, the top 10 countries had more government debt-to-GDP ratio than the sum of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of the rest of the countries.

## Comparison
A bar chart is one of the most effective tools to visualize data in a readable and understandable format. A bar chart is better used for representing a vast amount of data and comparing different values. The Government Debt Bar Chart represents the government debt-to-GDP ratio from the lowest to the highest so that it could provide the audience with a quick sense, such as Estonia had the lowest ratios and Japan had the highest.

Compared to a bar chart which is better used for larger changes, a line chart is better used for representing changing trends and developments over time. The 1995 - 2021 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Line Chart represents the changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio of all the countries over the past 20+ years, so it is easier for the audience to see the changes at one time. For example, Spain had the shortest period of government debt-to-GDP ratio.

Compared to a bar chart which is better used for category comparison or a line chart which is better used for representing trends over time, a pie chart is better used for showing the relationship between a whole and its parts. I chose the pie chart because I wanted to know the percentage of the top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage of the countries around the world. The pie chart shows that the top 10 countries that had the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio occupied over 50% of the total debt-to-GDP ratio. In other words, the top 10 countries had more government debt-to-GDP ratio than the sum of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of the rest of the countries.
